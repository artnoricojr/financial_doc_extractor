I'll explain the `_chunk_text` method in detail. This is a critical function for handling large documents that exceed the LLM's context window limits.

## **Purpose**

The `_chunk_text` method splits long text into smaller, manageable pieces ("chunks") that fit within the LLM's token limit while maintaining context and readability.

## **Why Chunking is Necessary**

* **Token Limits**: LLMs have maximum input token limits (e.g., 4,000-8,000 tokens)  
* **Cost Optimization**: Smaller chunks \= more efficient API calls  
* **Context Preservation**: Breaking at natural boundaries prevents cutting sentences mid-thought

## **How It Works \- Step by Step**

### **1\. Quick Exit for Small Text**

if len(text) \<= max\_chunk\_size:  
    return \[text\]

If the text is already small enough (≤3,000 characters), return it as-is in a single-item list. No splitting needed.

### **2\. Initialize Chunking**

chunks \= \[\]  
start \= 0

* `chunks`: List to store all text segments  
* `start`: Tracks where we are in the text (like a reading cursor)

### **3\. Main Chunking Loop**

while start \< len(text):  
    end \= start \+ max\_chunk\_size

Loop until we've processed all text. Calculate where this chunk should end (start position \+ 3,000 characters).

### **4\. Handle Last Chunk**

if end \>= len(text):  
    chunks.append(text\[start:\])  
    break

If we're near the end of the document, just take everything remaining and stop.

### **5\. Find Natural Break Point (Key Feature\!)**

break\_point \= end  
for i in range(end \- 100, end):  
    if i \> start and text\[i\] in '.\!?\\n':  
        break\_point \= i \+ 1  
        break

This is the **smart part**:

* Instead of cutting mid-sentence at exactly 3,000 characters  
* Look backwards up to 100 characters  
* Find the first sentence-ending punctuation (`.`, `!`, `?`, or newline)  
* Break there instead

**Example:**

Position 3000: "...the customer's annual income is $150,0|00 and their..."  
                                                      ↑ bad break\!

Position 2947: "...the customer's annual income is $150,000.|And their..."  
                                                             ↑ good break\!

### **6\. Save Chunk**

chunks.append(text\[start:break\_point\])

Add the text from `start` to `break_point` to our list of chunks.

### **7\. Overlap for Context (Critical\!)**

start \= break\_point \- self.chunk\_overlap

Move to the next chunk, but **back up** by `chunk_overlap` (200 characters).

**Why overlap?**

* Prevents information loss at boundaries  
* Provides context for the LLM  
* Handles cases where an attribute spans chunk boundaries

**Visual Example:**

Chunk 1: \[characters 0-3000\] \+ overlap  
Chunk 2:          \[characters 2800-5800\] \+ overlap  
         ↑\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_↑  
         200 char overlap

## **Complete Example**

Let's say you have this text (simplified):

"Customer John Doe signed the annuity policy on March 15, 2024\.   
His annual income is $85,000 and his net worth is approximately   
$450,000. The beneficiary is Jane Doe, his spouse..."

**If text is 6,500 characters:**

1. **Chunk 1** (chars 0-3000):

   * Contains: "Customer John Doe... net worth is approximately"  
   * Breaks at sentence end near 3000  
2. **Chunk 2** (chars 2800-5800):

   * Starts 200 chars before previous end (overlap)  
   * Contains: "...net worth is approximately $450,000. The beneficiary..."  
   * Notice the overlap captures "$450,000" again for context  
3. **Chunk 3** (chars 5600-6500):

   * Final chunk with remaining text

## **Key Parameters**

max\_chunk\_size: int \= 3000  \# Maximum characters per chunk  
self.chunk\_overlap \= 200     \# Characters to overlap between chunks

**Why 3000?**

* Roughly 750-1000 tokens (safe estimate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters)  
* Leaves room for the prompt, instructions, and response  
* Conservative to avoid hitting limits

**Why 200 overlap?**

* Typically covers 1-2 sentences  
* Ensures attributes that span boundaries are caught  
* Small enough to not waste too many tokens

## **Benefits for Financial Documents**

1. **Multi-page forms**: Breaks long applications into processable chunks  
2. **Context preservation**: Overlap ensures "Premium Amount: $50,000" isn't split  
3. **Natural boundaries**: Respects document structure  
4. **Efficiency**: Only processes what fits in the model's window

## **Potential Improvements**

You could enhance this by:

* Breaking at paragraph boundaries (`\n\n`) instead of just sentences  
* Using actual token counting instead of character estimates  
* Adjusting overlap based on attribute complexity  
* Adding chunk metadata (page sections, form fields, etc.)

Does this clarify how the chunking works? Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
